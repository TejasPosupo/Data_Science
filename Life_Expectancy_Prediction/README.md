## Project Explanation

![life expectancy]()

Life expectancy prediction is a process of estimating the average lifespan of an individual based on various factors such as age, gender, lifestyle, and medical history. Machine learning algorithms can be used to build models that can predict life expectancy with high accuracy.

In this project a linear regression model is used to predict the life Expectancy

The data was initially obtained from world heatlh organisation (WHO) and united nations website. Data contains features like year, status, life expectancy, adult, mortality, infant deaths, percentage of expenditure, alcohol etc.

The following are some of the factors that can influence life expectancy:

- Age: As people grow older, their risk of developing chronic diseases and other health problems increases, which can affect their life expectancy.

- Gender: Women tend to live longer than men due to biological differences and lifestyle choices.

- Lifestyle: Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet can have a significant impact on life expectancy.

- Medical history: People with a history of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer may have a lower life expectancy.
