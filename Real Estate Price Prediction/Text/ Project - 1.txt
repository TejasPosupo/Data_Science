we are going to start working on a real

life data science project today in this

tutorial series I will give you a

glimpse of what kind of steps and

challenges a data scientist working for

a big company goes through in his

day-to-day life assume that you are a

data scientist working for a real estate

company such as Zillow calm here in u.s.

or magic bricks calm in India your

business manager comes to you and asks

you to build a model that can predict

the property price based on certain

features such as square feet bedroom

bathroom location etc on Zillow calm

this feature is already available they

call it as estimate it shows you the

Zillow estimated price just to make this

project more fun we are also going to

build a website using HTML CSS in

JavaScript which can do home price

prediction for you in terms of project

architecture first we are going to take

a home price data set from Cagle calm

this is for a bangalore city in india

and using that data set will build a

machine learning model while building

the model will cover some of the cool

data science concepts such as data

cleaning feature engineering

dimensionality reduction outlier removal

etcetera once the model is built will

export it to a pickle file and then will

write a Python flash server which can

consume this pickle file and do price

prediction for you this Python flash

server will expose HTTP endpoints for

various requests and the UI written in

HTML CSS and JavaScript will make HTTP

GET and post calls in terms of tools and

technology we'll use Python as a

programming language will use pandas for

data cleaning Madrid flip for data

visualization SK learn for model

building Python flask for a back-end

server HTML CSS and JavaScript for our

website overall you will learn a lot and

it will be a very interesting project

for you so without wasting any more time

let's get started
