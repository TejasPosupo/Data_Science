in last video we went through some data

cleaning techniques in this video we

will be looking at some feature

engineering and dimensionality reduction

techniques at this stage my data frame

looks something like this now I'm going

to copy the data frame into a new data

frame let's call it D f5 and to do a

deep copy you can use copy function on a

data frame and I'm going to create now

price per square feet column here I have

total square feet okay and the total

price we all know that in real estate

market the price per square feet is very

important and this feature will help us

do some outlier cleaning in the later

stage okay so I am doing some feature

engineering here and creating a new

feature which can be helpful for outlier

detection and removal in the later stage

so df5 let's call this new column price

per square feet okay

and this column is nothing but a

division of two columns

okay so df5 price and this price you are

dividing it with your square foot area

now our price is in lakh rupees okay so

one lakh is okay so this is how it looks

like okay so one and then four five

zeroes actually and then D F dot head

excellent so now I have price per square

feet column here okay so let's keep this

column will look into this column later

but meanwhile we will now explore our

location column okay I have these

locations I want to check how many

locations are there and how many rows

are available in my data set or location

location is a categorical feature here

it's just a category it's a tax data

okay and if you have too many locations

it can create a problem so let's let's

first check how many locations I have in

total so if I do the f5 dot location dot

unique it will show me the unique number

of location okay and if I do the count

you will find that I have 1,300

locations which is a big number usually

to handle the text data we convert it

into dummy columns using one hot

encoding and if we keep all the

locations what's gonna happen is we will

have around 1300 columns in our data

frame which is just too much you know

it's like too many feature this is

called our dimensionality curse or you

know this is a high dimensionality

problem and there are techniques

available to reduce the dimensions one

of the very effective techniques is to

come up with this other category other

category means when you had 30 104

location you will find that there will

be many locations which will have only

one or two data point okay so how do you

find that so let's do something to

figure out how many data points are

available

or location and before I do that I want

to strip any extra spaces from the

location so that you know my data is

clean and you can do that by using this

lambda function okay so this will just

remove there is leading space or if

there is space at the end of the

location okay now I will create a

location stats variable which will give

me the statistics on location and I will

say DF Phi dot location or rather let's

say group by so I want to group by my

data frame by using location and

whatever I get as a result on that

a location column on which I will

perform aggregation function which will

give me the count pour location I want

to print it okay you can see that this

one giving a girl location has only one

data row okay

first phase JP Nagar has lesser 25 rows

okay

so this is good but I want to sort these

guys by number of data points okay and

to do that you can call sort values

function where you want ascending to be

false so now you can see that the

Whitefield location has maximum number

of rows in my CSV file 535 data points

okay and you see many location which has

only one data point so we can come up

with some threshold and say that any

location which has list then let's say

ten data points is called other location

okay so let's just do that so what I

will do is I want to know how many

locations have less than ten data points

okay and since location stats is a

series you can apply this kind of

condition and it will tell you that

there are thousand and fifty two

locations out of twelve hundred ninety

three which has less than ten data

points so this is pretty good now I can

use this to qualify a location as other

location I'm just going to call that

this and okay let's prepare this

let me see which locations have these

less than ten data points so all these

locations you see so I can put all of

these locations into a general category

called the other and before I do that I

will just print total number of unique

location in my data frames my D f5 here

you can see that this I'm still at the

f5 it has 1293 locations as unique

locations and now I'm going to apply a

transformation into this data frame and

call it the FI dot location is equal to

D fi dot location dot apply again I am

going to apply some lambda function here

and I will say that this location is

other if X is in location stats

locations test less than 10 else

whatever is the value you keep it after

this transformation is done what will

happen is all these locations will be

converted to other and then when you

print a unique location value you will

find that now I have only 242 locations

okay this is pretty good because when I

later on convert this into one hot

encoding I will only have 242 columns

let me just print some of the values

from data frame and you can see there

see this particular location is now

converted to other alright so that's all

I had for this video in the next video

we are going to look at outlier

detection and outlier removal
