## Project Explanation

![Customers Churn](https://github.com/TejasPosupo/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/ML/Telecom_churn_Prediction/Customer_Churn_Prediction_Models_in_Machine_Learning.png)

Telecom customer churn prediction is a task of predicting whether a customer is likely to switch to a competitor or terminate their subscription with a telecom provider. Churn prediction is a critical task for telecom providers, as customer retention is essential for business sustainability and growth. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, telecom providers can take proactive measures to retain them and improve customer loyalty.

To predict customer churn, telecom providers can use machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and identify patterns that may indicate a customer is likely to leave. Some of the factors that can be used to predict customer churn include:

- Call duration and frequency
- Customer demographics (age, gender, income)
- Service usage (data usage, text messages, international calls)
- Billing information (payment history, account balance)
- Customer service interactions (complaints, inquiries, support tickets)

To build a churn prediction model, telecom providers can collect historical customer data and use it to train a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can then be used to predict which customers are likely to churn based on the factors listed above. The accuracy of the churn prediction model can be improved by continuously updating it with new customer data and refining the algorithm.
